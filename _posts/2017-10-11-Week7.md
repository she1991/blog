<h1>This is a broad topic.</h1>
Modern front end development is a very broad area of work and can range from simple HTML to dynamic apps and awesome visualizations. Fortunately I have some experience with front end work and see myself as a practicioner. However the kind of work I have always done feel extreemly outdated when I look at the current state of the front end world.

<h1>Acknowledging my skills rot.</h1>
If you were to throw jargons like ES, Grunt file, bower toolchains etc.. I would have a very hard time comprehending you. The objective of this project is to acknowledge that a skills gap exists between me and the current state of front end tooling and framework. It is impossible to chase the latest and greatest of the trends - it is also not advisable. I will be narrowing my focus to learning and making use of Vuejs as the framework and understanding the tools that revolve around it.

<h1>The vessel.</h1>
I am using my portfolio website <a href="wwww.akash.me">here</a> as the platform on which I will be learning this. The goal is to build a Vuejs feedback form or popup so visitors can anonymously give me their qualitative feedback about my work - send me tips or critique my portfolio.
