<h1> React Native Setup Is Simple </h1>
I had tried to dipping my feet in mobile development many years ago, lost count. It wasn't as simple as this! Within 15 minutes I had all my dependencies in place and had the my cell phone running hello world in no time through the Expo app. Which is more of a virtual machine than an emulator. I hear this very hello worl would work out of the box on apple devices as well.

This is too easy!. I imagine things will get a bit hairy as I move forward - boxed-systems have great development experiences but very poor flexibility. As of today, I dont know if the React Native toolbox will be sufficient to address my vision for this project. I have put off investigating its feasability - as a conscious decision so that I do not get disheartened. I will handle problems as they come.

I did doodle this projected screen sequence for the qualitative logging tool I am building. Very simple and bare-bare-bones..

And the very high level component diagra - from a software engineering angle. Trying to keep thing extremely simple.

There were some hiccups in the initial installation, some missing packages - the watchman issue - a package that has to be installed via. brew because npm has a version that React Native does not play well with. I am keeping my lazer focus on working to learn React Native and I resolve issues with setup etc. without much thought to the 'whys' of what I am doing :(
