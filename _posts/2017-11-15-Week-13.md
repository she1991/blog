<h1>This is my first time exploring websockets</h1>
Couldn't believe how easy it was with socket.io and nodeJS [<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-websockets#option-2-socket-io">here</a>]. The latency between the heroku server and my cell phone seems tolerable. The next challenge will be to translate the movement details of the mobile phone (the accelerometer data) into directional values and communicate them in real time to the servers.
<h2>Accelerometer to direction input will be hard</h2>
I imagine that this will be a bit more mathemetical with a sprinkling of physics. I am comitted to getting this done, rather than involving myself with the nitty gritties of the Theory of Gravity. So, I'll be spending time trying to trawl the internet for npm packages or projects that already crunch this data and give me directional movement values. I am hoping I won't have to do the heavy lifting here.
<h2>This will be a cool project</h2>
The main sell of this project is the low friction, patrons can just access a webpage and start vitual spray painting. This is also my first VR like project. Though calling it VR would be a bit of overselling it.
