<h1>This will be an exciting experience</h1>
I am planning to create an art exhibit which will be a blank wall. A virtual wall, people can see this wall by accessing a URL. People will be able to vitually spray paint the wall by connecting to a URL and using their cell phones as virtual spray paint cans. Many people can come together and paint the wall at the same time.
<h2>What is being used</h2>
It is a client server model, but I will be using the following technologies that stand out:
1. Web Sockets - to relay the information as a continuous stream of data
2. Accelerometer API - to know the movement of the device in physical space
3. Heroku & NodeJS - server platforms 
<h2>Learning resources</h2>
I do not have a book or a course that I will be following, instead this will be built by googling, learning and repurposing. For starters we have this article that explain the HTML5 API (https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/). I am using this as a starting point in my journey. Everything else will be a mix of stackoverflow knowledge and trail and error.
<h2>Hard goals</h2>
People should be able to tag this vitual wall using their devices, this can ve a simple line drawing that follows their gestures. This is a hard goal for this project. Another hard goal is to allow multiplepeople to operate on a wall at the same time collaboratively.
